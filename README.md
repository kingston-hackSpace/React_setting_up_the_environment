<h1>Setting up the react environment</h1>

STEP1:

Firstly install Node js. This is the package manager that will help us deal with dependency libraries.

Load the terminal (found in the applications/utilities folder)

Enter the following command

<code>nvm  install 24</code>

STEP2:

Next we we need to install our build tools. We will be using Vite for this…

<code>npm install -g create-vite</code>

<code>npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react</code>

Navigate to your new react app. You can type cd then drag the folder into the terminal window as a shortcut.

<code>cd my-react-app</code>

STEP3:

Enter the following commands into the terminal

<code>npm install</code>
<code>npm run dev</code>

A browser window should open automatically, linking to localhost:3000 this is the webpage url for webpages served locally on the computer.

The react installation will have a boilerplate project to show it’s working.
